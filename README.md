## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-taking-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd note-taking-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the MongoDB server.

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

### Creating a Note

To create a new note, send a POST request to `/api/notes` with the title and content in the request body. If successful, the server will respond with the created note.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"New Note","content":"This is the content."}' http://localhost:3000/api/notes
```

### Retrieving Notes

To retrieve all notes, send a GET request to `/api/notes`. The server will respond with an array of notes.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/notes
```

### Retrieving a Single Note

To retrieve a single note by ID, send a GET request to `/api/notes/:noteId`, where `:noteId` is the ID of the desired note. If the note is found, the server will respond with the note details.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/notes/5f69aa979c3b5f001e2e78c0
```

### Updating a Note

To update a note by ID, send a PUT request to `/api/notes/:noteId` with the updated title and content in the request body. If successful, the server will respond with the updated note.

Example:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Updated Note","content":"Updated content."}' http://localhost:3000/api/notes/5f69aa979c3b5f001e2e78c0
```

### Deleting a Note

To delete a note by ID, send a DELETE request to `/api/notes/:noteId`, where `:noteId` is the ID of the note to be deleted. If successful, the server will respond with a confirmation message.

Example:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/5f69aa979c3b5f001e2e78c0
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/notes`: Create a new note.
- `GET /api/notes`: Retrieve all notes.
- `GET /api/notes/:noteId`: Retrieve a single note by ID.
- `PUT /api/notes/:noteId`: Update an existing note by ID.
- `DELETE /api/notes/:noteId`: Delete a note by ID.

## Middleware

The application includes middleware for data validation and error handling.

### Data Validation Middleware

- Validates that the request body contains both a title and content for creating or updating a note.

### Error Handling Middleware

- Handles validation errors by sending a 400 Bad Request response with details about the validation errors.
- Handles invalid ID errors (CastError) by sending a 400 Bad Request response with a message indicating an invalid ID format.
- Handles other errors by logging the error and sending a 500 Internal Server Error response with a generic error message.

## Database Schema

The application uses a MongoDB database with a simple note schema. Each note has a title, content, creation date (`createdAt`), and last update date (`updatedAt`). The schema includes validation rules for title and content length.

```javascript
const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Title is required'],
    trim: true,
    minlength: [3, 'Title must be at least 3 characters long'],
    maxlength: [50, 'Title cannot exceed 50 characters'],
  },
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Content is required'],
    trim: true,
    minlength: [10, 'Content must be at least 10 characters long'],
    maxlength: [5000, 'Content cannot exceed 5000 characters'],
  },
